Restricts the Addon PAC3
If you are using this addon for a server or single player and are planning to customize it make sure to use the correct one.

If you are planning to use both I would recommend getting both addons and combining them into one file to make your life easier.
When customizing your permissions make sure to keep the format of the usergroups or steamid {IE ["Owner"] or ["STEAM:1:001]}

If you are throwing this into your server files make sure to put it into your addons as is.
